/* Challenge:
- Render an <App /> component
- App should be in its own file
- App should render 4-5 <Joke /> components 
  (Joke component defined in its own file too)
- Each Joke should receive a "setup" prop and a "punchline" prop
  and render those however you'd like
- Use your favorite 2-part jokes (setup & punchline), or check
  jokes.txt file for some examples.



EXTRA CREDIT:
-Some jokes are only a punchline with no setup:

E.g.: Because you’ve got everything I’m searching for

-If you don't pass in a "setup" prop, how might you make it only 
show the punchline?
